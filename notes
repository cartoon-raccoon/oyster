Oyster - A shell written in Rust

Mostly POSIX-compliant; is essentially a re-implementation of Zsh/Bash in Rust

Plans might include to implement a custom scripting language

Other names:
Oyshter? (Ew)

Built-in commands:
cd *
which 
eval
source
export *
echo
read
kill
alias *
let *
exit *

Features:
Autocompletion
job control (done)
Basic scripting
shell expansions
    -> $(command) || `command` (done)
    -> $variable (done)
    -> ~ to home dir (done)
    -> - (when used with cd) to previous dir
    -> !! to last command (in editor)
    -> button.{js, css} to button.js, button.css (done)

Todo:
Char matching for cursor
    -> Up shows history
    -> Left/Right moves cursor
    -> Down does nothing
Break up the token parser function into smaller functions
    for the shell expansion to use part of the functionality
Fix escaping for $
Add quote tracking for command substitution
